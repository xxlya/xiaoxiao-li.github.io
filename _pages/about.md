Hi, I am Xiaoxiao Li. I am an Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and an Associate Member in the Computer Science Department at the University of British Columbia (UBC), leading the <a href="https://ubc-tea.github.io/lab-web/"> Trusted and Efficient AI (TEA) Lab</a>. I am also a core faculty member of <a href="https://blockchain.ubc.ca/core-management-team">Blockchain@UBC</a>, a member of <a href="https://bmiai.ubc.ca/">Biomedical Imaging and Artificial Intelligence</a>, and a member of <a href="https://leap-project.github.io/">LEAP project</a>. Starting from 2022, I am an adjunct Assistant Professor at Yale University. 
 
Before joining UBC, I was a postdoc in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton, working with <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~li/">Prof. Kai Li</a> and <a href="https://function.princeton.edu/">Prof. Olga Troyanskaya</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Yale University, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/james-duncan?destination=node%2F309">Prof. James Duncan</a>. I received Yale Advanced Graduate Leadership Fellowship. I obtained my B.S. (honors degree) from Chu Kochen College, Zhejiang University, China, in June 2015. 

My current research lies in machine learning and its application to healthcare and blockchain. Our research topics cover deep learning, computer vision, trustworthy AI, data economy, medical image analysis and so on. I aim to narrow the gap between AI research and its applications by developing the next-generation trustworthy AI systems. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
